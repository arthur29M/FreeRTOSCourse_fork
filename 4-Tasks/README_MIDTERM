1 - MIDTERM Overview :

The BlinkAssignment project demonstrates advanced multitasking on the Raspberry Pi Pico using FreeRTOS.
Key features: 
- Blink multiple external LEDs on GPIO pins 0–7.
- Blink onboard LED (GPIO 25) concurrently.
- Mix of task types: BlinkAgent, BlinkWorker, BlinkHeavy.
- Added stress-test CPU tasks to explore task limits.

Monitor using FreeRTOS runTimeStats() and USB serial output.
The project focus on task priorities, stack usage, and task scheduling environment.

In total we are running 3 styles of tasks described above. Additionally I decided to stress test the board by adding "useless" cpu load tasks.

2. SOP
Press and hold the BOOTSEL button on the Pico.
Connect the Pico to USB (or drag .uf2 to the RPI-RP2 drive).
Release the BOOTSEL button.
Pico will reboot and start running the program.
Open VSCode Serial Monitor (or any terminal software).
The program will start the following tasks:
  External LEDs (GPIO 0–7) blink via BlinkAgent, BlinkWorker, BlinkHeavy tasks.
  Onboard LED (GPIO 25) blinking task.
  Optional CPU stress-test tasks for performance evaluation.
  Monitor system stats via runTimeStats() which prints:
  Task number and name
  Current and base priority
  Stack high-water mark
  Heap usage (available memory, blocks, allocations, frees)
